- currently working on MNIST dataset using tensorflow to understand softmax

- [X] mnist softmax.ipynb => dataset size: train data
- - -        Number of data points :  55000 Number of pixels in each images 784
             We applied model on data but failed to plot results using matplotlib
             I don't know what the heck is going on at last step of <a href = "https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/softmax-classifier-using-tensorflow-on-mnist-dataset-with-sample-code-6538d0783b84">this tutorial</a>
             in the title of "Now summarizing everything in a single cell".. If anyone viewing this please contribute and send me pull request with explaination of what going on in last section.. You are welcome to contribute..: ) 
- One of the best article on word2vec <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa">here</a>

-[x] CBOW model => (context_window, target_word) => predict the target word using the context_window.. Again failed due to erros.. please help
